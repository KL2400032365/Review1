Peer Review Platform Slide Deck

Files:
- `peer-review-deck.md` — Reveal-style markdown deck (slides separated by `---`).

How to view quickly:
- Option A (recommended): install `reveal-md` and open locally
  - `npm i -g reveal-md`
  - `reveal-md docs/peer-review-deck.md --open`

- Option B: paste the markdown into an online Reveal editor or use a local HTML template that loads Reveal.js and the markdown plugin.

Export to PowerPoint:
- If you need a `.pptx`, I can either:
  - Produce a PowerPoint file using `python-pptx` (requires Python and `python-pptx` installed), or
  - Convert the Reveal deck to PDF via a headless browser and then to PPTX (requires additional tools).

Next steps I can take:
- Add speaker notes per slide (expanded).
- Generate a `.pptx` export of the deck.
- Create wireframes/images and embed into slides.

Tell me which of the above you want next and I'll proceed.
